This connection is best exemplified in the following theorem of Gauss: \begin{equation} \int_S K dA = 2\pi\chi(S) \end{equation} where $S$ is a surface, the term on the left is the integral of the Gauss curvature of the surface, and on the right we have the Euler characteristic $\chi(S)$, which is a topological invariant of $S$. Other connections between curvature and topology are found, for instance, in the Bonnet-Myers theorem (curvature and compactness) and Hadamard’s theorem (spaces of nonpositive sectional curvature).</p> <p><em>to be continued</em></p> <h3 id="potato">Potato</h3> <p><a href="https://github.com/satyu2004/tomato">Code Repository</a> Sathya is the the best</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="experiments"/><category term="curvatures"/><category term="math"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Network Analysis Inspired by Riemannian Geometry]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Entropy Simply Explained</title><link href="https://satyu2004.github.io/blog/2023/Entropy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Entropy Simply Explained"/><published>2023-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://satyu2004.github.io/blog/2023/Entropy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://satyu2004.github.io/blog/2023/Entropy/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-equation">The Equation</h2> <p>We have all come across the ubiquitous equation</p> <p>\begin{equation} E = - \sum p(x) \log{p(x)} 2\pi\chi(S) \end{equation} or its continuous cousin \begin{equation} E = - \int p(x) \log{p(x)} 2\pi\chi(S) dx \end{equation}</p> <p>whether we are doing statistical mechanics, physics, differential geometry, or even data science. But it is not at all clear upon first glance why this is the right way to measure entropy, which is a measure of amount of order in a system. I mean, where is the \(p(x) \log{p(x)}\) term even coming from?</p> <h2 id="surprise">Surprise</h2> <p>What we mean by <em>surprise</em> here is something very specific and technical. Given a sample space, each element $x$ has an associated probability of occurrence $p(x)$. Now, suppose you picked \(x\) at random. How surprising is it that you drew an $x$? Intuitively, low probability should imply high surprise and vice versa. So one might suggest \(S(x)=1/p(x)\) as a measure of surprise. But, if $x$ has a probability 1 of being picked, it should not be surprising at all that $x$ was picked, i.e. the surprise should be 0. Thus, a better candidate would be \begin{equation} S(x)=\log{1/p(x)}=- \log{p(x)}. \end{equation}</p> <p>Recall that</p> <p><em>to be continued…</em></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/satyu2004/tomato">Code Repository</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="statistics"/><category term="data"/><category term="science"/><category term="physics"/><category term="curvatures"/><category term="math"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The meaning behind the mysterious equation]]></summary></entry></feed>
