Hi! I'm Sathya, a problem-solver by nature and mathematician by profession. This website is a window to my research interests, learnings and my creative outputs. Please explore, and reach out if you want to find out more about my work!

## Current Research
My current work is at the intersection of geometry and network analysis, with a view towards applications. More specifically, I study the Ricci curvature of discrete structures such as graphs, simplicial complexes etc. This idea has been applied in diverse areas like *social network analysis, financial mathematics, cancer research, image processing* etc.

Apart from theoretical aspects, there is a strong emphasis on **algorithms, programming, computation, data processing** and **visualization** in my current research. 

## PhD Thesis Research
My PhD thesis is on the subject of *geometric flows*, a confluence of partial differential equations, convex geometry and Riemannian manifolds, with applications from *mathematical relativity* to *image processing, edge detection* etc. Intuitively, think of this as a process that deforms irregular, wrinkly surfaces into more nice, regular ones. It is modeled on *heat diffusion*, where curvature spreads from wrinkly regions into flat regions to create more uniform shapes.

I explore "ancient solutions" to fully nonlinear curvature flows, the well-studied *mean curvature flow* being a particular case thereof. This work adds to our understanding of the general phenomenon of geometric flows, by studying it from a point of view of very general families of flow speeds and exploring how the choice of flow speed affects the shapes of solutions. I was mentored by Drs. Theodora Bourni and Mathew Langford.

## Master's Research
During my Master's, I worked on the phenomenon of synchrony, which at the intersection of dynamical systems and differential equations, and has applications to mathematical biology, power systems etc. Synchrony is ubiquitous in the natural world, seen in its most splendid form in the arising of spontaneous synchrony in fireflies. The *Kuramoto Model* is a powerful mathematical model that captures this phenomenon, and this is the subject of my Master's research.

## Beyond Pure Math
Besides pure mathematics, I am also interested in areas such as **Machine Learning** and **Quantitative Research**.

I am also a recreational tennis player and hiker.
