Sathya Rengaswami is a 5th year PhD candidate exploring the beauty behind theoretical concepts within Abstract Mathematics. Throughout his academic career, he is focusing on **Fully Nonlinear Curvature Flows** in the field of Differential Geometry.

His research objective is understanding the **effects of the flow speed function and its relationship to the geometry of solutions**. More recently, he is investigating more applied areas of Mathematics, such as **Machine Learning** and **Quantitative Research**.

In his free time, he enjoys playing tennis and spending time outdoors.
